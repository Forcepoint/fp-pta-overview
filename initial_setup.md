## Initial Setup

1. Go through the provided git example hosts, which are focused on packer against CentOS 7 and Windows 10,
Terraforming your golden images, and setting up the PTA Controller.

1. Call out that copying the code from the pta-controller-node-01 example is a good starting point.
Then if you need something from the pta-controller-master example, add it in (like the directions
for creating a certificate).
